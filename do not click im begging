            and love u give to me. I wish you had a happy year like mine with being together. Thank you
            for understanding me all the time even when I make mistakes in our relationship. I am
            grateful that despite my immaturity, you still stayed. I also appreciate you because of the
            things you share, which help me to become more mature. Also, for treating me to good and
            bad food (kwek-kwek huhu) and giving me time to accompany me on my errands, thank you
            for never getting tired of dropping me off and picking me up at my dorm. We've been
            through a lot of fights and I hope we learned from it. I hope that despite everything, you
            continue to love and respect me more and more and more. And me gonna do the same. I
            appreciate all the efforts and gifts for every special event you give to me I'm trying my best
            to save and collect them all and decorate them in my room and use it. And also I'm not so
            mayaman and perfect but I'm trying my best to give and satisfy you your wants in life. But I
            promise when I'm so yaman I'm gonna spoil you all the way. I'm sorry for whatever my
            pagkukulang is and sorry if I failed to live up to your standards. But I hope we spend more
            years again together and be strong and understanding with each other more. And I just want
            to remind you that I love you always Love and I'm here for you always. Happy Birthday
            again and Happy Anniversary!`;
